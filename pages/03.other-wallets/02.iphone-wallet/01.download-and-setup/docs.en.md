Set a secure password for your Nem wallet, it is important to keep your account safe. Every time you open the app, it asks for your password, therefore you shouldn't forget it and make a backup of your password. After setting up a password, it will go to the home page of the app. That looks like this:

You can have multiple accounts with their corresponding addresses and give each a unique name so you will not get confused which account is which. After naming your account, click on the 'Create' button. Your account will be created, and it will bring you to a page where all your accounts are listed, which looks like this:
